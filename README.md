# Tools-Altered-for-Combatibility
A mod for Minecraft: Java Edition that makes vanilla and modded tools com(b)atible for PVP and PVE.

### How do I install this mod?
Head right over to the mod's [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tools-altered-for-combatibility) to install through Forge. (Fabric version coming soon!)
### How do I contribute new content to this mod?
Well, there's a guide for exactly that, and you can find it right [here](https://github.com/RepeatGitHub/Tools-Altered-for-Combatibility/wiki)! 
### Which items are affected?
For the most part, this mod changes the item values of pickaxes, shovels, and hoes, in order to make them around as viable for combat as swords and axes.
### What mods does this mod support?
Well, there's a list on the Curseforge, but there is also a list [here](https://github.com/RepeatGitHub/Tools-Altered-for-Combatibility/wiki/Planned-Additions-and-Banned-Additions#already-added-additions).
### What are the new values of affected vanilla/modded items?
I've written down the [vanilla item changes](https://github.com/RepeatGitHub/Tools-Altered-for-Combatibility/wiki/Vanilla-Item-Values), but I haven't done modded yet.
